## Steps/Plan

1. Set up the PostgreSQL database.
2. Create the Flask API to interact with the database.
3. Develop the crawler engine to fetch data from the ETLE system.
4. Integrate the crawler engine with the database.
5. Schedule the crawler to run at regular intervals.
6. Test the complete system.

## Requirements/Tasks

- Install PostgreSQL and set up the database.
- Install Flask and required Python packages.
- Develop the Flask API for data retrieval.
- Implement the crawler engine to fetch data from the ETLE system.
- Schedule the crawler engine to automate the data fetching process.
- Validate the system with available data.
- Document the system.

## What Did We Learn?

- A functional proof-of-work can be established even with limited data.
- Flask and PostgreSQL integration is efficient and reliable for this use-case.
- The main challenge was the limited availability of sample data for testing.
- With more comprehensive data, the system can be improved significantly.

## Limitations

Due to the limited availability of sample data, this project serves mainly as a proof-of-work. With access to a more comprehensive dataset, the system could employ more advanced techniques and offer a richer set of features.
